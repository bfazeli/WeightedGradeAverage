# WeightedGradeAverage

calculates a weighted average for a student.

A weighted average difers from a straight average in that to calculate a weighted average, you must multiply
each category's average by its weight. For example, in a class you might have a Test category,
a Homework category, and a Quiz category. Tests might be worth 25% of your total grade,
Homework might be worth 40%, and Quizzes would then be worth 35%. The percentages
must sum to 100%. In this case, the weight of each category is the decimal equivalent to
how much of the grade it is worth. Hence, the Test weight is 0.25, the Homework weight is
0.40, and the Quiz weight is 0.35.
